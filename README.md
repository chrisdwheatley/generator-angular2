# Generator Angular2

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/swirlycheetah/generator-angular2.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/swirlycheetah/generator-angular2)  [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/swirlycheetah/generator-angular2](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/swirlycheetah/generator-angular2?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) Generator to aid in bootstrapping an Angular2 application using the very latest Angular2 alpha release.

### Getting Started

Install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) (for the build process and development server), and this generator globally.

```bash
npm install -g yo gulp generator-angular2
```

Run the generator in your desired project folder.

```bash
yo angular2
```

You'll be prompted to start the server once the generator has finished.

You'll then be able to access the application at `http://localhost:8000`. Serving the application can be configured in the `gulpfile.js` using [gulp-webserver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-webserver) options.

### Generated Structure

The structure generated is;

```
- src
	- index.js
	- index.html
	- {generated-file-name}.js
	- {generated-file-name}.html
- .editorconfig 
- .gitignore
- gulpfile.js
- package.json
- readme.md
```
